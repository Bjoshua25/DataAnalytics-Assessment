## ðŸ§© Assessment\_Q1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

### **Problem Statement**

**Scenario**:
The business wants to identify customers who have **both a savings and an investment plan**, signaling an opportunity for **cross-selling** and deeper engagement. The goal is to find high-value customers who are actively using multiple financial products.

---

### **Objective**

Identify customers who have:

* At least **one funded savings plan**, and
* At least **one funded investment plan**
  Then, calculate the **total amount deposited** and sort the results in descending order of deposit value.

---

### **Tables Used**

* `users_customuser` â€“ Customer demographic info
* `savings_savingsaccount` â€“ Deposit transaction history
* `plans_plan` â€“ Plan types and ownership

---

### **Logic Overview**

* A **savings plan**: `is_regular_savings = 1`
* An **investment plan**: `is_a_fund = 1`
* Only consider **funded plans** where `confirmed_amount > 0`
* Count plan types per user using `COUNT(DISTINCT CASE ...)`
* Aggregate confirmed deposits (converted from **kobo to naira**)
* Filter to include only customers meeting **both** savings and investment criteria
